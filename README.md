Collector-Desktop
=================

Collector-Desktop is the desktop client of a collection manager suite originally 
developed by Jérôme Wagener and Paul Bicheler. This repository is currently in
private mode until most bugs are fixed and the code is cleaned up!

The project was imported from a local SVN repository. Thus no prior revision history
is available. This also means that the original commit is a collaboration by Paul and Jérôme.

Have fun ;)
