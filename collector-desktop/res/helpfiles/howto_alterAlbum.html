		<h1>How-to alter an existing Album</h1>
		<p>If you want to alter an existing album, then simply use the "Alter selected Album" entry within the Album menu item</p>
		<p>This will then show all available update possibilities within the right sidebar. While the renaming of an album is
		executed by clicking the rename button, other actions such as adding a new field to the album are performed using the context
		menu of the album-summary-table</p>
		<p>The album-summary-table allows (via context-menu) to reorder, delete and add fields. These actions are performed immediately.</p>
